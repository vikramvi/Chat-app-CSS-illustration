## Overview

This is _16th project_ from "Frontend Mentor" to sharpen HTML & CSS skills along with responsive web design and it's build with "BEM", "Grid & Flexbox layout", "min-width, max-width, width in various units, icon / image placements & with help of Google ofcourse".

This is most complex project from Frontend Mentor's HTML and CSS set of projects, I took 2.3 md to complete the same.

You can see the commit history to see the approach I've followed to solve this most complex project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

### What I learned

- It helps to break down big problem into smallest possible and start solving those small problems one by one
